# AIP - Advanced Interactive PHP

AIP is an interactive PHP shell that is closely integrated with Reflection API
to add many interesting and useful features that other interactive PHP shells
doesn't support.

AIP is greatly inspired by PRY for Ruby.

__Currently AIP is in a very early development stage__
